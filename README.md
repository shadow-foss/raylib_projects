# C++ Raylib Projects

Welcome to my collection of C++ projects built using Raylib! This repository showcases the games and applications I've developed while honing my skills in C++. Each project represents a significant step in my journey towards mastering game development and graphics programming.

## üìö About Raylib

Raylib is a simple and user-friendly library that facilitates game and multimedia application development in C++. With its powerful API and focus on simplicity, it‚Äôs an ideal choice for both beginners and experienced developers.

## üöÄ Projects

In this repository, you‚Äôll find a variety of projects, including but not limited to:

- **Simple Games**: Engaging experiences like clickers and platformers.
- **Interactive Applications**: Tools and utilities that enhance user interaction.
- **Visual Experiments**: Demos that explore different graphics techniques and concepts.

## üí° Learning Objectives

Through these projects, I aim to:

- Deepen my understanding of C++ and foundational game design principles.
- Explore various aspects of graphics programming.
- Implement features such as user input handling, animations, and core game mechanics.

## üõ†Ô∏è Getting Started

To run any of the projects, follow these steps to set up Raylib using vcpkg:

### Step 1: Install vcpkg

1. **Clone the vcpkg repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/microsoft/vcpkg.git
   ```
2. **Navigate to the vcpkg directory**:
   ```bash
   cd vcpkg
   ```
3. **Run the bootstrap script**:
   - On Windows:
     ```bash
     .\bootstrap-vcpkg.bat
     ```
   - On macOS or Linux:
     ```bash
     ./bootstrap-vcpkg.sh
     ```

### Step 2: Install Raylib

1. **Install Raylib using vcpkg**:
   ```bash
   ./vcpkg install raylib
   ```

2. **Integrate vcpkg with your build system**:
   To make vcpkg available in all your projects, run:
   ```bash
   ./vcpkg integrate install
   ```

### Step 3: Build and Run Projects

1. Open your preferred IDE or editor.
2. Load the project you wish to run.
4. Follow the specific instructions in each project's README for building and running.
